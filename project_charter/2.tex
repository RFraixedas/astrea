\section{Scope of the project}
This section establishes the scope of the project. \\\\
{\bfseries Satellite development} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item An establishment of the mission requirements that influence any parameter of the satellite will be developed. These requirements include size, weight, spacecraft subsystems and payload. 
	\item Based on these conditions, the CubeSat size will be chosen.  
	\item The design of the spacecraft subsystems will be in charge of a specialized enterprise that will work strictly following the requirements talked before. 
\end{itemize}

{\bfseries Orbital design.}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The orbit design will be accomplished according to the results of several studies such as visibility between satellites and between satellites and ground stations, collision avoidance, orbital decay avoidance and stated requirements as global coverage, low earth orbit, low latency. 
	\item The number of satellites and the number of orbital planes will be deducted from those studies. 
	\item A study will be carried out to clarify if the Earth is the only celestial body that will influence the satellites or others, for instance, the Moon or the Sun will also have to be considered. 
	\item The specific existing legislation will be taken into an account and followed during all the orbit development.
\end{itemize}

{\bfseries Constellation Deployment.} 

\begin{itemize}
	\item A comparison among the existing launch platforms will be carried out to find out the one that fulfills the mission requirements and a reasonable economical conditions.
	\item A launching window/s will be reserved if the launch platform chosen requires it. 
	\item The recommendations of Joint Space Operation Center will be followed and their application form will be filled up to ensure all the launch procedure accomplishes the legislation. 
\end{itemize}

{\bfseries Operation.} 

\begin{itemize}
	\item An analysis will be done to clarify how many ground stations must operate and the possibility of placing a central one in UPC ESEIAAT.
	\item The requirements and costs of the ground station will be determined. 
	\item Communication logistics will be defined.
	\item An end of life strategy will be designed according to CubeSat lifespan, orbit decay, replacement stratagem of the company and legislation procedures. 
\end{itemize}

{\bfseries Exhibition.}

\begin{itemize}
	\item It will consist on a simulation of the constellation.
